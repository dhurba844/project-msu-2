# Project 2: Chef's Table!

Chef's Table! is an app that allows you to save your favorite recipes in one spot.

## User Story

We wanted to create a place for people to be able
to store all of their favorite recipes in one spot
No more printing out a ton or recipes or
scrolling through multiple websites to find
that perfect recipe you're looking for.
